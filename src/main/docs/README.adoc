// This README aligns with the "Project Style Guide" for AsciiDoc documentation.

This directory contains all project documentation, written in AsciiDoc format to maintain clarity and consistency.
By storing these documents here, we facilitate iterative updates, especially when collaborating with AI tools or multiple team members.

== Purpose

* Ensure all project documentation is centralised, version-controlled, and easy to update.
* Provide clear references to the functional requirements, style guides, and other relevant AsciiDoc documents.
* Support iterative development by making it straightforward to modify and regenerate documentation.

== Contents

* link:Requirements.adoc[Requirements.adoc] – Functional requirements and specifications for the *Posix* library.
  Covers code generation details, POSIX calls, fallback strategies, and more.

* style-guide.adoc (if present) – The main style guide describing coding, Yaml, Maven, and AsciiDoc conventions.
  Refer to it for best practices when adding or updating project files.

== Updating the Documentation

1. **Open the `.adoc` file** you wish to modify (e.g. `Requirements.adoc`).
2. **Make changes** following the *Project Style Guide* rules:
   - Use British English.
   - Keep paragraphs short and active.
   - Insert code blocks with `[source,java]` or `[source,bash]` tags, as appropriate.
3. **Cross-check** references (xref links, file names, headings).
4. **Generate output** (HTML, PDF) to verify formatting.

== Working Iteratively with AI Tools

This directory supports an iterative, documentation-driven approach:
- Prompt AI tools with partial `.adoc` files or propose modifications.
- Review changes in a preview environment (e.g. local Asciidoctor, Git diff).
- Incorporate relevant edits, delete padding or incorrect suggestions, and refine until final.

== Contributing

If you have suggestions or need to add new documentation:
- Follow the established directory structure.
- Name files meaningfully (e.g. `new-feature-overview.adoc`).
- Update cross-references in `Requirements.adoc` or this README if linking related content.
- Avoid duplication by referencing existing `.adoc` files whenever possible.

[TIP]
====
You can add short `// add:` comments to propose wording improvements or placeholders for additional details.
These do not render in the final output but serve as markers for future iterations.
====

== Licence

All documentation here is provided under the same licensing terms as the main codebase, stated in the link:../../LICENSE.adoc[LICENSE.adoc].
This ensures consistent permissions and limitations across both code and documentation assets.

== Contact

If you have any questions or require assistance:
- Consult the *Project Style Guide* for general guidelines.
- Contact the project maintainers or raise an issue in the repository.
